Our paper [From Keypoints to Object Landmarks via Self-Training Correspondence: A novel approach to Unsupervised Landmark Discovery](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10005822) has been accepted for publication at _IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence_. The paper extends our [NeurIPS 2020](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2020/hash/32508f53f24c46f685870a075eaaa29c-Abstract.html) work on unsupervised landmark discovery both conceptually and experimentally!
