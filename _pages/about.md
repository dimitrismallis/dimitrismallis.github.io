Welcome! I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust (SnT)](https://www.uni.lu/snt) of the **University of Luxembourg**, focusing on 3D Computer Vision and it's applications for Computer-Aided Design (CAD).

I received my PhD in Computer Vision at the **University of Nottingham** under the supervision of [Dr. Yorgos Tzimiropoulos](https://ytzimiro.github.io/). I was also a Research Intern at [Samsung AI Cambridge (SAIC)](https://research.samsung.com/aicenter_cambridge) and later a Senior Machine Learning Engineer for [Taboola](https://www.taboola.com/) and [Deeplab](https://deeplab.ai/).

### Research

During my PhD, I concentrated on learning with minimal manual supervision through _self-supervised_ and _semi-supervised learning_, specifically for the tasks of _landmark detection_ and _human pose estimation_. Later, I also looked into deep learning based recommender systems and _click through rate_ prediction. My current focus in on 3D vision, and its application towards accelerating _parametric computer-aided design (CAD)_.
