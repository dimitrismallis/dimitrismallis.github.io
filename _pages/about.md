Welcome!! ðŸ‘‹  I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust (SnT)](https://www.uni.lu/snt) of the **University of Luxembourg**, focusing on computer vision its appliations for Computer-Aided Design (CAD).

I received my PhD in Computer Vision at the **University of Nottingham** under the supervision of [Dr. Yorgos Tzimiropoulos](https://ytzimiro.github.io/). I was also a Research Intern at [Samsung AI Cambridge (SAIC)](https://research.samsung.com/aicenter_cambridge) and later a Senior Machine Learning Engineer for [Taboola](https://www.taboola.com/) and [Deeplab](https://deeplab.ai/).

### Research

During my PhD, I concentrated on learning with minimal manual supervision through self-supervised and semi-supervised learning, specifically for the tasks of landmark detection and human pose estimation. Later, I also looked into deep learning based recommender systems and the problem of click-through-rate (CTR) prediction. 

Currently my focus in on 3D vision and it's application towards accelerating parametric Computer-Aided Design (CAD). I am particularly interested in automated reverse engineering of 2D/3D CAD models as well as Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for AI-assisted design. I also lead [Morfis](https://morfisai.github.io/), an SnT project focused on AI-assisted physical product customization.
