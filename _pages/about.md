I received my PhD in Computer Vision at the [University of Nottingham (UK)](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/research/groups/cvl/) under the supervision of [Dr. Yorgos Tzimiropoulos](https://ytzimiro.github.io/). I was also a PhD Intern at [Samsung AI Cambridge (SAIC)](https://research.samsung.com/aicenter_cambridge) and later worked as a Senior Machine Learning Engineer for [Taboola](https://www.taboola.com/) and [Deeplab, Athens](https://deeplab.ai/). Currently, I am a Posdoctoral Researcher with the [Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust (SnT)](https://wwwfr.uni.lu/snt) of the [University of Luxembourg (UL)](https://wwwen.uni.lu/).

My research focuses on learning for vision tasks (Landmark Detection, Human Pose Estimation) under limited supervision (Self-Supervised Learning, Semi-Supervised Learning). Moreover, I have also looked into deep learning-based Recommender Systems, and more recently I am focusing on 3D Computer Vision and particularly applications on computer-aided design (CAD).
